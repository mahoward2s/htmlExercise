    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.  On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.  It had been Molly's favorite book since follege, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in thsi room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
